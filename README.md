# Heart Disease Prediction Using AI & ML

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to **predict heart disease** using clinical data and advanced algorithms. By analyzing medical data, the model identifies patterns associated with heart disease and provides accurate early diagnosis, which is critical for saving lives.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. Traditional diagnosis methods can be expensive, slow, and inaccurate. This project uses AI and ML techniques to build a predictive model that:
- Enhances early detection
- Reduces misdiagnosis
- Improves healthcare resource optimization

## 🛠️ Methodology

- **Dataset**: Heart Disease Dataset with 1026 records and 14 features.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes (NB)
- **Best Performing Model**: 
  - 🔥 **KNN** with **98.37% accuracy**
  - 📈 **KNN + NB (KNNB)** ensemble achieved **99.26% accuracy**

## 📊 Key Features Used

- Age, Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
- ECG Results, Heart Rate
- Exercise-induced angina, ST depression

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC-ROC

## 📌 Results

| Model  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| SVM    | 88.53%   | 87.00%    | 90.00% | 88.50%   |
| NB     | 96.70%   | 98.00%    | 96.50% | 96.50%   |
| KNN    | 98.37%   | 98.50%    | 98.25% | 98.50%   |
| KNNB   | 99.26%   | 98.75%    | 99.38% | 99.50%   |
